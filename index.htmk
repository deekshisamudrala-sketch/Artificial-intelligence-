If you want to simulate writing, use Python’s turtle or graphics libraries.
✔ If you want real writing, use Arduino or Raspberry Pi with servo and stepper motors.
✔ The machine receives text, translates it into movement, and physically writes it using a pen.

Let me know if you want:

A full Arduino code with stepper motor wiring details

A Python GUI for entering messages

Help selecting components (servo, motor drivers, etc.) for building this setup
